<h1>
Million Steps Challenge #1
</h1>
<p>
Inspired by the "Workin' Things Out" Walking 1 Million Steps in 1 Month Challenge
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0eiXmambKg&list=PLLu5R0TaU4w_0vwUNHGLsyK5aoM5C0DW3">Click here</a>),
A group of teams was gathered to see if they could also walk one million steps. However,
the one month qualification was changed to a custom amount per team. However, all teams
but one fizzled out.

<h2>Team A</h2>

Finished in 23 days!

Team A is a team of one individual. This walker used an Omron HJ-113 pedometer clipped to the
belt to track steps.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p class="question">
How fast do you walk?
</p>
<p class="answer">
I walk on average one mile in 16:40. And with about
2,000 steps per mile, one hour of walking yields about 7,200 steps.
This means I averaged about 6 hours of walking everyday for 23 days
straight. I measured my pace on a track with my pedometer several
times.
</p>
<p class="question">
How much weight did you lose?
</p>
<p class="answer">
I lost about 10 pounds. However, I feel that that number is a bit misleading.
I started this challenge in the midst of a longer weight loss program. So I was
already walking quite a bit, and walking 20,000 steps a day was not that unusual.
So this challenge at best just increased any weight loss I would have achieved
anyway. I think a better measure is the decrease in body fat percentage. In the
23 days, I lost about 2% body fat. I do believe all the extra walking was the
reason for this, and I don't feel I would have lost that much had I just kept my
previous pace.
</p>
<p class="question">
How was the challenge? How hard was it to walk 500 miles?
</p>
<p class="answer">
I have done step challenges before, and I know how
much time they can consume. So I initially didn't feel like doing one
million steps in one month. I decided that 42 days would be my length
of the challenge. However, after two days, I decided that there was
plenty of time to complete the challenge in one month which would
match the original one month challenge time. So my original daily
average of 30,000 steps went to over 40,000 steps.
</p>
<p class="answer">
After nearly two weeks of walking, I
was feeling great and thinking about how it might be possible to do
the challenge in less than 28 days. A few factors were in my favor.
First, the weather was great. Great temperatures and
very little rain storms to schedule around. The worst day was just
dealing with remnants of a hurricane. Second was the pandemic in that
all social engagements were canceled. Furthermore, working from home
changed the time spent commuting into time spent walking. The steps
accumulated steadily.
</p>
<p class="answer">
However, into the third week, feelings changed. A
feeling of restlessness overwhelmed everything. Sitting down to rest
was a bit hard; I seemingly unconsciously found myself
getting up to look out the window when I required much needed rest.
When not walking, time seemed best spent looking forward to the next
window to walk. Also, several times, I woke up at four in
the morning and ready to walk, despite my legs needing more
rest. My legs only felt well when walking. So, I felt that the
best thing to do was to finish this challenge as quickly as possible.
After all, 50,000 steps wasn't that much more than 40,000, much like
60,000 steps wasn't that much more than 50,000. Quitting was never
considered. Therefore, I put up a couple of days with more
than 60,000 steps. This led the challenge to finish in 23 days on a
Monday holiday. So after it was done, I was able to get back to my
other hobbies. Do not underestimate the time needed to walk 500
miles in 23 days.

<p class="answer">
There were some bad affects. Because I was already walking quite a bit,
I didn't expect problems with blisters, but I did get a minor one in an
unusual place on a toe, but a band-aid solved that easily, and I didn't
have any other injuries to speak of. But the the worst part of the challenge
is that I got some really thick callouses. It took about two months for
my feet to return to its pre-challenge softness. But wow, make no mistake
how tired your legs and feet can get after hours and hours of walking.
</p>
<p class="question">
Would you do it again? 
</p>
<p class="answer">
Absolutely, but not any time soon... well to be specific, I won't be
trying to beat my personal record any time soon. You might see me doing lengthier
challenges though.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I think trying to get over a 50,000 step daily average would be the next
plateau to achieve. Doing one million steps in less than 20 days would be
the goal.
</p>
<p class="answer">
In this challenge, I split my walking mostly into
four time slots. I walked early in the morning before work. I then walked a
bit during lunch and before dinner. I probably then walked the bulk of the steps 
in the evening.  To do better, I would wait until I was retired, then try
to split the walking into three main daily time slots... morning, afternoon and
evening, and walk about two and a half hours for each time slot. An afternoon
nap would also help. Finding yourself needing to do the longer four hour walks
is not where you want to be. Many smaller walks is better than a couple of
long walks.
