<h1>
Walk Across America - Challenge #3
</h1>
<p>
This challenge is the "virtual" walk across America. Google Maps tells me that the distance from the
beach at Coney Island in New York City to the end of pier at Santa Monica, Los Angeles is 2,808 miles.
</p>
<p>
That distance is approximately 5,616,000 steps, so this challenge is a year-long one. We are also tracking
how far we run. A secondary goal is to see how close we can get to running 500 miles, and a tertiary
goal is to see how close we can get back to our college weight.

<h2>Team A</h2>
