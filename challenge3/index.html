<h1>
Walk Across America - Challenge #3
</h1>
<p>
This challenge is the "virtual" walk across America. Google Maps tells me that the distance from the
beach at Coney Island in New York City to the end of pier at Santa Monica, Los Angeles is 2,808 miles.
</p>
<p>
That distance is approximately 5,616,000 steps, so this challenge is a year-long one. We are also tracking
how far we run. A secondary goal is to see how close we can get to running 500 miles, and a tertiary
goal is to see how close we can get back to our college weight.
</p>

<h2>Team A</h2>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p class="question">
How fast do you walk?
</p>
<p class="answer">
I walk on average one mile in 16:40. And with about
2,000 steps per mile, one hour of walking yields about 7,200 steps.
</p>
<p class="question">
Almost Six Million Steps in one year?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Yep. I am also mixing in some running.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period one go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
It went very well. I am off to a great start. The walking is easy and most enjoyable.
The running also went well as I ran a lot more than I ever expected. I even ended this
period with a 10K+ run. My main worry about running was if I could keep up a 10 mile
weekly average. It seems very much so. I also got my remaining average down to less than
9.3 miles, and therefore I can complete my goal with just three simple 5K runs per week
for the remainder of the challenge. Having the ability to take four days off per week
from running will make my ankle very happy, but I don't expect that is what I will do.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The weather is also co-operating more than I expected. I haven't had to avoid that many
snow storms. I even went running in the snow once. It was the kind of snow that didn't
accumulate though. The biggest hurdle to getting outside is the short cloudy days. I
think there was a week where one didn't see the sun. I look forward to warm sunny days
of summer.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I think the biggest lesson I need to learn is to take more rest days. I don't need to
walk my daily average everyday. I need to be content with just several thousand steps
for a day. But that will easier to live with when I have a remaining average that is
closer to 12,500 steps.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period two go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
The theme for period two was winter! Lots of snow and frigid temperatures! I wouldn't be
surprised if I received more than 50cm of snow in the last few weeks. But despite the
challenge of the weather, I was able to get my steps and runs in, and I passed my
first milestones: one million steps and 100 miles.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I was able to continue to decrease my remaining weekly average for running. But I feel
it is best for my foot health that I just run three times a week for now and use the days
off for healing. But I must say, I have a strong urge to decrease the remaining daily
step average to below 14,000. So I will focus my efforts on that over the next two periods.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I am looking forward to the switch to daylight savings time, and longer and warmer days.
As I write this, the sidewalks are still buried under ice and snow, but I see many warm
days in the forecast to begin the melting process. For now, I will just have to make do with
the limited areas where I can walk and run. I should remember to note how many days or weeks
go by before I can get back to walking out of my neighborhood without having to go around
giant piles of snow.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period three go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
To answer the question from last period, I did venture out of my neighborhood on day five
of above freezing temperatures. The sidewalks were still dicey with very slick wet ice.
I had to be very careful and leap out into the busy road to avoid long stretches of icy
walkways. Day six's high temperature was well above average and melted a lot of snow. By
day seven, walking around was largely back to normal, for there was only one large pile of
snow that required walking around. Spring-like rain is now becoming the weather story.
I will keep you up to date on how long the snow piles last. Will they last through the
month?
