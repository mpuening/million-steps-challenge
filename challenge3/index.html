<h1>
Walk Across America - Challenge #3
</h1>
<p>
This challenge is the "virtual" walk across America. Google Maps tells me that the distance from the
beach at Coney Island in New York City to the end of the pier at Santa Monica, Los Angeles is 2,808 miles.
</p>
<p>
That distance is approximately 5,616,000 steps, so this challenge is a year-long one. We are also tracking
how far we run. A secondary goal is to see how close we can get to running 500 miles, and a tertiary
goal is to see how close we can get back to our college weight.
</p>

<h2>Team A</h2>
<p>
Team A is a team of one individual. This walker uses an Omron HJ-321 kept safely in a pocket to track steps.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p class="question">
How fast do you walk?
</p>
<p class="answer">
I walk on average one mile in 16:40. And with about
2,000 steps per mile, one hour of walking yields about 7,200 steps.
</p>
<p class="question">
Almost Six Million Steps in one year?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Yep. I am also mixing in some running.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period one go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
It went very well. I am off to a great start. The walking is easy and most enjoyable.
The running also went well as I ran a lot more than I ever expected. I even ended this
period with a 10K+ run. My main worry about running was if I could keep up a 10 mile
weekly average. It seems very much so. I also got my remaining average down to less than
9.3 miles, and therefore I can complete my goal with just three simple 5K runs per week
for the remainder of the challenge. Having the ability to take four days off per week
from running will make my ankle very happy, but I don't expect that is what I will do.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The weather is also co-operating more than I expected. I haven't had to avoid that many
snow storms. I even went running in the snow once. It was the kind of snow that didn't
accumulate though. The biggest hurdle to getting outside is the short cloudy days. I
think there was a week where one didn't see the sun. I look forward to warm sunny days
of summer.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I think the biggest lesson I need to learn is to take more rest days. I don't need to
walk my daily average everyday. I need to be content with just several thousand steps
for a day. But that will easier to live with when I have a remaining average that is
closer to 12,500 steps.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period two go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
The theme for period two was winter! Lots of snow and frigid temperatures! I wouldn't be
surprised if I received more than 50cm of snow in the last few weeks. But despite the
challenge of the weather, I was able to get my steps and runs in, and I passed my
first milestones: one million steps and 100 miles.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I was able to continue to decrease my remaining weekly average for running. But I feel
it is best for my foot health that I just run three times a week for now and use the days
off for healing. But I must say, I have a strong urge to decrease the remaining daily
step average to below 14,000. So I will focus my efforts on that over the next two periods.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I am looking forward to the switch to daylight savings time, and longer and warmer days.
As I write this, the sidewalks are still buried under ice and snow, but I see many warm
days in the forecast to begin the melting process. For now, I will just have to make do with
the limited areas where I can walk and run. I should remember to note how many days or weeks
go by before I can get back to walking out of my neighborhood without having to go around
giant piles of snow.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period three go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
To answer the question from last period, I did venture out of my neighborhood on day five
of above freezing temperatures. The sidewalks were still dicey with very slick wet ice.
I had to be very careful and leap out into the busy road to avoid long stretches of icy
walkways. Day six's high temperature was well above average and melted a lot of snow. By
day seven, walking around was largely back to normal, for there was only one large pile of
snow that required walking around. Spring-like rain is now becoming the weather story.
I will keep you up to date on how long the snow piles last. Will they last through the
month? No, my last snow pile disappeared on Day 18 after temperatures went above freezing.
By the end of this period, there are many days of Spring like weather, and with the time change,
I have more time in the evening to walk or run while the sun is out.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The walking and running remains easy. As I wanted, I drove up my daily average of steps to
20,000. This is driving down my remaining daily average nicely. I will continue to drive
down the average. As for the running, it could not really be going better. I still find
it easy to run four miles, and even doing so four times a week. My remaining weekly
average is even almost down to eight miles, which means I would need to only run twice
a week. My speed is also getting better. I completed one run with a pace of 7:47 per
mile. The numbers show that I completed a third of the running challenge, and I am
one third the way to five million steps. It is nice to be ahead of schedule, but still
I feel no need to take my foot off the gas.
</p>
<p class="answer">
One part of the challenge that I have not mentioned yet is weight. I had a couple of times
in which I got to within ten pounds of the goal. This is nice, but really means that I
only shed a good chunk of the weight I gained over the holidays. Being realistic, I have
the next five months to lose the remaining ten pounds. That is two pounds per month. Towards
the end of summer, I am sure I will start to gain weight which is usual. Therefore, I really
need to start watching what I eat. Honestly, I haven't been focusing on that, and I'm still
eating plenty of candy and ice cream. Two pounds per month should be do-able if I watch what
I eat.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period four go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
When writing up this period's summary, it snowed about five centimeters in the overnight hours.
When I woke up, the snow that covered all the trees was absolutely beautiful. My reaction was
similar to Ralphie from The Christmas Story when he opened up the window to view the ice covered
neighborhood on Christmas morning. But like most spring time snow falls, the snow was gone by evening.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The big news this period is that I updated the summary tables with new goals. For a couple of periods
now I have been thinking about new goals, because the current goals just seemed to easy to reach. Now,
when starting this challenge I told myself I would not update the goals, and I would not be so obligated
to getting steps. Unfortunately, I do feel that way, but oddly I enjoy it. And I must add that I already
did change the goal once. The original goal was five million steps. While being a nice round number,
I felt people would not understand how far that is. So I changed it adding more steps to make it a
walk across America. However, I have watched Forrest Gump several times this year, and could not
help think that Forrest walked from the Santa Monica Pier to the Marshall Point Lighthouse in Maine.
This is adding more than a half million steps, but I feel confident about walking that far. Running
wise, I changed the goal from 500 miles to 620 miles, or 1000 kilometers. In keeping my promise to not
change the goals, I say that I will commit to the orginal ones, but call these new goals, "stetch" goals.
That way I can still feel challenged but have something fall back to in case of something bad happening.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The bad news for this period is that I need to report my first injury. I have developed a bad case
of tendonitis, and so I will be taking a couple of weeks off from running in hopes it heals well enough
so I can resume my previous pace.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The incredible news this period is that I started watching what I eat in in order to lose weight. And to my
astonishment, the weight started coming off quickly. I already got close to a couple of kilograms from my goal.
That is nearly two months work completed in a few weeks. Hopefully, I will be back running soon to lose the rest.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period five go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Even though we are getting deep into Spring, the weather remains on the chilly side. I don't even
want to count the number of days when the daily high temperature doesn't reach the average low
temperature. Hearing frost warnings in the weather forecast seems to becoming commonplace. But
while my long running pants and hoodie remain in the laundry rotation, at least it isn't super cold
like winter.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I have returned to running after taking time to heal, and now I must take care to not aggravate the injury
again. So, I am limiting my routes to 5Ks, and not the four milers that I was doing before. Of course, to
reach my goal for the year, I need to run four times a week. And that means I will accomplish my new stretch
goal at the end of the year. I must say I would prefer more buffer room. So that means I must either
find time to get additional runs in once in a while, or revert to just my original goal of 500 miles.
Time will tell.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period six go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Ah... the halfway point. Ok, technically the halfway point is still two weeks away, but since I took so long
to add in the graphs in the manner I wanted, it is actually close to the half way point. I'm glad to report that
I already past the halfway point on my walking stretch goal awhile ago and I continue to decrease the remaining
step average. In fact, I am at the point where I am making some serious dents in that average. I am really having
fun watching the average go down.
</p>
<p class="answer">
On the running front, I began the period with shorter runs, but after awhile I realized that I was able to get
back to running 4 milers. And then while out on a run, I was doing math in my head and I figured that I was able
to get to the 300 mile mark before the end of the period. And I thought that would be a great feat to report on.
But then silly me, I was working on the math again, and I figured that the actual 310 mile midway mark was
also achievable. So I pushed myself and lo and behold, I made it! 500km at the end of period six. Whew! Honestly,
I pushed myself a little bit hard, and I need to have a recovery week. But I can't forget that it now being summer,
time is right to get extra mileage in so I am not forced to be running so much in the cold weather. So I do plan to
put in weeks with 15+ miles in them. If I can eliminate the the need to run in the last period, I would be ecstatic.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I still have not obtained my weight goal. But I have gotten to within 1kg of the goal. I think if I take a vacation
week from work, I can put in the effort to eliminate that last little bit of weight.
</p>
<p class="answer">
Lastly, I would be amiss if I didn't mention the cicadas! Yes, period six was the emergence of Brood X, the largest
and perhaps most famous brood of cicadas. After having a delayed start due to the colder temperatures, the cicadas 
finally came out in force. There were plenty of cicadas on the sidewalks and I made every effort to avoid squishing
them. But I could not tell you have many times they flew into my body both front and back and even my face. I even
had a few fly onto my shoulders and catch a ride for who knows how long before I glanced over to notice them hitching.
But they are fun little creatures.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period seven go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
I was reflecting on what I wrote for period one. There, I asked myself to learn about the importance of rest days, but
I knew a rest day would only be easy to take once I decreased my daily average to a value that allowed me to easily
make up those steps quickly (as in the next day). And sure enough, I recently did take a rest day purposely, and as I
predicted, I could not help but make up the steps the next day; which was not too difficult seeing how my average
is getting low.
</p>
<p class="answer">
While the steps average seems automatic to continue to decrease, my primary focus is most definitely on the running
average. While I am pleased at what it is now, I would be most pleased once I get the average down to 8 miles per week.
That would be a great average. Unlike walking, I cannot easily go out and run extra miles. It just doesn't work that way.
Right now, I am trying to keep my ankle healthy which mostly means not running too many extra miles.
</p>
<p class="answer">
Football season is approaching, and that is the reason I am driving my averages down. It would be very comforting to me
knowing that I only need to run twice a week to keep pace to finish. So I should continue besting that amount
to decrease the average to the point where I don't need to run in the winter. Football season will take up Thursday,
Saturday, Sunday and Monday. And then there will be some football on Friday. So that leaves Tuesday and Wednesday and
Saturday morning to get runs done.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I also can't seem to shake the idea of changing the walking goal to seven million steps. I know, it's ridiculous. But
I can't help myself from thinking it. As is stands as I write this, I need about 16,500 steps per day to accomplish
that goal. And again, as before, it's an average I would like to see dwindle down to 12,500. I will still keep putting
up solid numbers, and from time to time look at what the remaining average is. Then we'll see. 
</p>
<p class="answer">
My last update for this period is that I accomplished my weight goal! Yes, I did it! I had a weigh-in for the goal
of this challenge. Sadly though, I achieved the goal the day before a holiday weekend full of too much eating. Hey,
why lose weight if you can't put a little back on from a party. So now, I get the achieve the goal yet again. But
I remind you, I don't have to finish this challenge at the weight; I just had to reach it once, and I did. It doesn't
matter if I pack on 10kgs for the rest of the challenge. I hope I don't, but perhaps a kg or two is fine.
