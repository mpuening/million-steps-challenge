<h1>
Walk Across America - Challenge #3
</h1>
<p>
This challenge is the "virtual" walk across America. Google Maps tells me that the distance from the
beach at Coney Island in New York City to the end of pier at Santa Monica, Los Angeles is 2,808 miles.
</p>
<p>
That distance is approximately 5,616,000 steps, so this challenge is a year-long one. We are also tracking
how far we run. A secondary goal is to see how close we can get to running 500 miles, and a tertiary
goal is to see how close we can get back to our college weight.
</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p class="question">
How fast do you walk?
</p>
<p class="answer">
I walk on average one mile in 16:40. And with about
2,000 steps per mile, one hour of walking yields about 7,200 steps.
</p>
<p class="question">
Almost Six Million Steps in one year?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Yep. I am also mixing in some running.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period one go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
It went very well. I am off to a great start. The walking is easy and most enjoyable.
The running also went well as I ran a lot more than I ever expected. I even ended this
period with a 10K+ run. My main worry about running was if I could keep up a 10 mile
weekly average. It seems very much so. I also got my remaining average down to less than
9.3 miles, and therefore I can complete my goal with just three simple 5K runs per week
for the remainder of the challenge. Having the ability to take four days off per week
from running will make my ankle very happy, but I don't expect that is what I will do.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The weather is also co-operating more than I expected. I haven't had to avoid that many
snow storms. I even went running in the snow once. It was the kind of snow that didn't
accumulate though. The biggest hurdle to getting outside is the short cloudy days. I
think therewas a week where one didn't see the sun. I look forward to warm sunny days
of summer.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I think the biggest lesson I need to learn is to take more rest days. I don't need to
walk my daily average everyday. I need to be content with just several thousand steps
for a day. But that will easier to live with when I have a remaining average that is
closer to 12,500 steps.
