<h1>
Walk Across America - Challenge #3
</h1>
<p>
This challenge is the "virtual" walk across America. Google Maps tells me that the distance from the
<span class="old">beach at Coney Island in New York City</span> Marshall Point Lighthouse in Maine
to the end of the pier at Santa Monica, Los Angeles is <span class="old">2,808</span> 3,136 miles.
</p>
<p>
That distance is approximately <span class="old">5,616,000</span> 6,300,000 steps, so this challenge is
a year-long one. We are also tracking how far we run. A secondary goal is to see how close we can get to
running <span class="old">500</span> 700 miles, and a tertiary goal is to see how close we can get back
to our college weight.
</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p class="question">
How fast do you walk?
</p>
<p class="answer">
I walk on average one mile in 16:40. And with about
2,000 steps per mile, one hour of walking yields about 7,200 steps.
</p>
<p class="question">
Almost Six Million Steps in one year?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Yep. I am also mixing in some running.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period one go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
It went very well. I am off to a great start. The walking is easy and most enjoyable.
The running also went well as I ran a lot more than I ever expected. I even ended this
period with a 10K+ run. My main worry about running was if I could keep up a 10 mile
weekly average. It seems very much so. I also got my remaining average down to less than
9.3 miles, and therefore I can complete my goal with just three simple 5K runs per week
for the remainder of the challenge. Having the ability to take four days off per week
from running will make my ankle very happy, but I don't expect that is what I will do.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The weather is also co-operating more than I expected. I haven't had to avoid that many
snow storms. I even went running in the snow once. It was the kind of snow that didn't
accumulate though. The biggest hurdle to getting outside is the short cloudy days. I
think there was a week where one didn't see the sun. I look forward to warm sunny days
of summer.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I think the biggest lesson I need to learn is to take more rest days. I don't need to
walk my daily average everyday. I need to be content with just several thousand steps
for a day. But that will easier to live with when I have a remaining average that is
closer to 12,500 steps.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period two go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
The theme for period two was winter! Lots of snow and frigid temperatures! I wouldn't be
surprised if I received more than 50cm of snow in the last few weeks. But despite the
challenge of the weather, I was able to get my steps and runs in, and I passed my
first milestones: one million steps and 100 miles.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I was able to continue to decrease my remaining weekly average for running. But I feel
it is best for my foot health that I just run three times a week for now and use the days
off for healing. But I must say, I have a strong urge to decrease the remaining daily
step average to below 14,000. So I will focus my efforts on that over the next two periods.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I am looking forward to the switch to daylight savings time, and longer and warmer days.
As I write this, the sidewalks are still buried under ice and snow, but I see many warm
days in the forecast to begin the melting process. For now, I will just have to make do with
the limited areas where I can walk and run. I should remember to note how many days or weeks
go by before I can get back to walking out of my neighborhood without having to go around
giant piles of snow.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period three go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
To answer the question from last period, I did venture out of my neighborhood on day five
of above freezing temperatures. The sidewalks were still dicey with very slick wet ice.
I had to be very careful and leap out into the busy road to avoid long stretches of icy
walkways. Day six's high temperature was well above average and melted a lot of snow. By
day seven, walking around was largely back to normal, for there was only one large pile of
snow that required walking around. Spring-like rain is now becoming the weather story.
I will keep you up to date on how long the snow piles last. Will they last through the
month? No, my last snow pile disappeared on Day 18 after temperatures went above freezing.
By the end of this period, there are many days of Spring like weather, and with the time change,
I have more time in the evening to walk or run while the sun is out.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The walking and running remains easy. As I wanted, I drove up my daily average of steps to
20,000. This is driving down my remaining daily average nicely. I will continue to drive
down the average. As for the running, it could not really be going better. I still find
it easy to run four miles, and even doing so four times a week. My remaining weekly
average is even almost down to eight miles, which means I would need to only run twice
a week. My speed is also getting better. I completed one run with a pace of 7:47 per
mile. The numbers show that I completed a third of the running challenge, and I am
one third the way to five million steps. It is nice to be ahead of schedule, but still
I feel no need to take my foot off the gas.
</p>
<p class="answer">
One part of the challenge that I have not mentioned yet is weight. I had a couple of times
in which I got to within ten pounds of the goal. This is nice, but really means that I
only shed a good chunk of the weight I gained over the holidays. Being realistic, I have
the next five months to lose the remaining ten pounds. That is two pounds per month. Towards
the end of summer, I am sure I will start to gain weight which is usual. Therefore, I really
need to start watching what I eat. Honestly, I haven't been focusing on that, and I'm still
eating plenty of candy and ice cream. Two pounds per month should be do-able if I watch what
I eat.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period four go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
When writing up this period's summary, it snowed about five centimeters in the overnight hours.
When I woke up, the snow that covered all the trees was absolutely beautiful. My reaction was
similar to Ralphie from The Christmas Story when he opened up the window to view the ice covered
neighborhood on Christmas morning. But like most spring time snow falls, the snow was gone by evening.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The big news this period is that I updated the summary tables with new goals. For a couple of periods
now I have been thinking about new goals, because the current goals just seemed to easy to reach. Now,
when starting this challenge I told myself I would not update the goals, and I would not be so obligated
to getting steps. Unfortunately, I do feel that way, but oddly I enjoy it. And I must add that I already
did change the goal once. The original goal was five million steps. While being a nice round number,
I felt people would not understand how far that is. So I changed it adding more steps to make it a
walk across America. However, I have watched Forrest Gump several times this year, and could not
help think that Forrest walked from the Santa Monica Pier to the Marshall Point Lighthouse in Maine.
This is adding more than a half million steps, but I feel confident about walking that far. Running
wise, I changed the goal from 500 miles to 620 miles, or 1000 kilometers. In keeping my promise to not
change the goals, I say that I will commit to the orginal ones, but call these new goals, "stetch" goals.
That way I can still feel challenged but have something fall back to in case of something bad happening.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The bad news for this period is that I need to report my first injury. I have developed a bad case
of tendonitis, and so I will be taking a couple of weeks off from running in hopes it heals well enough
so I can resume my previous pace.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The incredible news this period is that I started watching what I eat in in order to lose weight. And to my
astonishment, the weight started coming off quickly. I already got close to a couple of kilograms from my goal.
That is nearly two months work completed in a few weeks. Hopefully, I will be back running soon to lose the rest.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period five go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Even though we are getting deep into Spring, the weather remains on the chilly side. I don't even
want to count the number of days when the daily high temperature doesn't reach the average low
temperature. Hearing frost warnings in the weather forecast seems to becoming commonplace. But
while my long running pants and hoodie remain in the laundry rotation, at least it isn't super cold
like winter.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I have returned to running after taking time to heal, and now I must take care to not aggravate the injury
again. So, I am limiting my routes to 5Ks, and not the four milers that I was doing before. Of course, to
reach my goal for the year, I need to run four times a week. And that means I will accomplish my new stretch
goal at the end of the year. I must say I would prefer more buffer room. So that means I must either
find time to get additional runs in once in a while, or revert to just my original goal of 500 miles.
Time will tell.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period six go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Ah... the halfway point. Ok, technically the halfway point is still two weeks away, but since I took so long
to add in the graphs in the manner I wanted, it is actually close to the half way point. I'm glad to report that
I already past the halfway point on my walking stretch goal awhile ago and I continue to decrease the remaining
step average. In fact, I am at the point where I am making some serious dents in that average. I am really having
fun watching the average go down.
</p>
<p class="answer">
On the running front, I began the period with shorter runs, but after awhile I realized that I was able to get
back to running 4 milers. And then while out on a run, I was doing math in my head and I figured that I was able
to get to the 300 mile mark before the end of the period. And I thought that would be a great feat to report on.
But then silly me, I was working on the math again, and I figured that the actual 310 mile midway mark was
also achievable. So I pushed myself and lo and behold, I made it! 500km at the end of period six. Whew! Honestly,
I pushed myself a little bit hard, and I need to have a recovery week. But I can't forget that it now being summer,
time is right to get extra mileage in so I am not forced to be running so much in the cold weather. So I do plan to
put in weeks with 15+ miles in them. If I can eliminate the the need to run in the last period, I would be ecstatic.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I still have not obtained my weight goal. But I have gotten to within 1kg of the goal. I think if I take a vacation
week from work, I can put in the effort to eliminate that last little bit of weight.
</p>
<p class="answer">
Lastly, I would be amiss if I didn't mention the cicadas! Yes, period six was the emergence of Brood X, the largest
and perhaps most famous brood of cicadas. After having a delayed start due to the colder temperatures, the cicadas 
finally came out in force. There were plenty of cicadas on the sidewalks and I made every effort to avoid squishing
them. But I could not tell you have many times they flew into my body both front and back and even my face. I even
had a few fly onto my shoulders and catch a ride for who knows how long before I glanced over to notice them hitching.
But they are fun little creatures.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period seven go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
I was reflecting on what I wrote for period one. There, I asked myself to learn about the importance of rest days, but
I knew a rest day would only be easy to take once I decreased my daily average to a value that allowed me to easily
make up those steps quickly (as in the next day). And sure enough, I recently did take a rest day purposely, and as I
predicted, I could not help but make up the steps the next day; which was not too difficult seeing how my average
is getting low.
</p>
<p class="answer">
While the steps average seems automatic to continue to decrease, my primary focus is most definitely on the running
average. While I am pleased at what it is now, I would be most pleased once I get the average down to 8 miles per week.
That would be a great average. Unlike walking, I cannot easily go out and run extra miles. It just doesn't work that way.
Right now, I am trying to keep my ankle healthy which mostly means not running too many extra miles.
</p>
<p class="answer">
Football season is approaching, and that is the reason I am driving my averages down. It would be very comforting to me
knowing that I only need to run twice a week to keep pace to finish. So I should continue besting that amount
to decrease the average to the point where I don't need to run in the winter. Football season will take up Thursday,
Saturday, Sunday and Monday. And then there will be some football on Friday. So that leaves Tuesday and Wednesday and
Saturday morning to get runs done.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I also can't seem to shake the idea of changing the walking goal to seven million steps. I know, it's ridiculous. But
I can't help myself from thinking it. As is stands as I write this, I need about 16,500 steps per day to accomplish
that goal. And again, as before, it's an average I would like to see dwindle down to 12,500. I will still keep putting
up solid numbers, and from time to time look at what the remaining average is. Then we'll see. 
</p>
<p class="answer">
My last update for this period is that I accomplished my weight goal! Yes, I did it! I had a weigh-in for the goal
of this challenge. Sadly though, I achieved the goal the day before a holiday weekend full of too much eating. Hey,
why lose weight if you can't put a little back on from a party. So now, I get the achieve the goal yet again. But
I remind you, I don't have to finish this challenge at the weight; I just had to reach it once, and I did. It doesn't
matter if I pack on 10kgs for the rest of the challenge. I hope I don't, but perhaps a kg or two is fine.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period eight go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
What else can I say other than I'm getting into the heart of the dog days of summer. Some days are just plain HOT
and HUMID! But there are stretches of very nice weather, so I hope I get more of them than the soupy days where
one sweats immediately after stepping outside. I have found myself gravitating towards walking as it gets dark
outside. Oh, I can also mention the other bugs that have moved in now that the cicadas are gone: lightening bugs
(fireflies), June bugs, Japanese beetles, crickets, and beautiful monarchs.
</p>
<p class="answer">
There are many days when I am beyond my weight loss goal. In fact, the lowest weight that I achieved so far is one
kilogram beyond my goal. And with that, there is little more to say about this goal.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I have decided to change the walking goal to seven million steps. I quickly grew tired watching a low daily walking
average dwindle to an even lower value. I still want a challenge since I still have plenty of time left in this year.
So now I have another chance to get the average of 12,500 steps again. I ended this period having a remaining daily
average less than 15,000 steps. I am thinking I should be fine decreasing this amount by 1,500 steps over the next
period. I have done it this period, and it should be easy enough in the next.
</p>
<p class="answer">
Now, nearly all the attention is put on the running challenge. I did some projecting, and sure enough, there is a path
to completing 700 miles. Why would I even think about doing this? Simple, it is because I am stupid. Seriously, my current
average is enough to cover the distance, but I would have to run to the very end of the challenge which is something I
do not want to do. So the idea is now to put in a bunch of extra miles and work off those weeks now while it's warm
and there is plenty of light in the evening. Football season has also started, so I am brain-storming ideas how to get
more miles done while also having fun doing it. Can I do three 10Ks each week?
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period nine go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
While returning from a 10K run one evening, a neighbor remarked to me that it was a nice evening for my walk. I
replied that indeed it was a nice evening, except that my "walk" was complete, and it was less of a walk and more
of a 6-mile race. My neighbor replied "Wow... good for you." I thanked my neighbor for the compliment, and we went
about our evenings. However, that remark kept swimming about in my mind, for the inflection seemed less like "WOW!
Good for you!" and more like "Whoa... you can run six miles?" Hmmm... I am thinking that my neighbor hasn't even run
60 feet in a long while, so the inflection is probably more the awe of how far six miles is than a slight against
me in that people wouldn't believe that I can run six miles. But it got me to thinking about how people perceive
me when I am running about. I don't profess to be an elite runner. Besides, what traits does one look for in
deciding what an elite runner would look like? Do I look swift and light on my feet? Or do I look old and decrepit
with plodding feet? I have been races where I was running behind people that I wouldn't ever guess could be in
front of me. And yes, I have been passed by runners pushing strollers with babies in tow. But still, I commonly
finish in the top third of my age group in races. A friend told me that he once saw a running shirt with "Over 50,
overweight, diabetic, ahead of you" written on the back. Funny shirt. Good for me for having never seen the shirt
in front of me in a race. The only hint I get that people might think I run is the few occasions people have
commented on my big calves. I think that is more genetics than anything else, but perhaps I don't look completely
out of place when running about. Well, I thought I would share that story, although it makes no difference in how
I will do things.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The Olympics finished up a few weeks back, and the one event I made sure to watch were the marathons. It always
amazes me that the runners make running looks so easy, and their pace over the entire race is faster than I could
ever run in a sprint. Most interesting to me was the training that these runners do. There are times where they
run 140 miles per week (20 miles per day). So impressive! 20 miles to me is a good total for a whole week. I can
imagine a marathoner returning from a daily run before I even wake up... we'd be sitting there eating breakfast...
the marathoner all pepped up after the run and me still sluggish trying to wake up knowing that he or she has
already run more than I would all week. But regardless of the ability difference, I have renewed enthusiasm to run
more and train for some races. Races were not part of my original plan, but because of how well my running has been
going and how the races are scheduled in this bizarre year, I figured I would give them a go.
</p>
<p class="answer">
This period I reached the "once upon a time" goals of five million steps and 500 miles running! So, good for me!
One should easily understand why I wanted to increase my goals.... I still have four periods left to accomplish more
feats. In fact, I almost reached the next walking goal of 5.6M steps, but because I took several "vacation" days
from walking and running, I will fall short of that. But no big deal. I have less than 1.5M steps left to hit my
latest and greatest walking goal. And that should be rather easily to achieve.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The focus remains running, but now with more concentration on race training. With that in mind, I plan to back
off from my previous amount of walking (e.g., > 150,000 steps / week). It is important that I get more rest days
from walking in exchange for longer runs. But I think that won't happen until I get to the magical number of
12,500 remaining step average. I am almost there.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period ten go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
It is probably a coincidence that in this period I reached the milestones for both six million steps walking and
six hundred miles running. But I am still short on both completing the "Walk Across America" goal and the 1000K
running challenge. Those goals should be met next period.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The race training goes phenomenally. I am now in half marathon shape... it is amazing that at the beginning of this
challenge I was thinking back to back 5K's might be difficult, and now I can go 12 miles without much trouble. I
love it.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I signed up for a race a couple of weeks ago after a long time of not doing races. It was a 14K race and I crushed it.
I am so stoked about that! More races to come?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Let me also add that September is the pick month of the year around these here parts. I enjoyed wonderful weather.
The down side is that the sun sets early and evening walks and runs end in the dark, but I have planned for that.
It is also autumn now and the colder weather is setting in. The tree leaves have not yet started turning colors
en-masse though.
</p>
<p class="question">
Congratulations! It's day 289 and you have completed your "Walk Across America!" In fact, you have completed all the
goals for this challenge. How do you feel?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Yes! I did it! And to be clear, we are not referring to the initial New York to LA goal, but instead the longer Forrest Gump
version from the Santa Monica Pier to the Marshall Point Lighthouse in Maine. Wow... what a relief. I have been averaging over
ten miles of walking and/or running a day for nearly a year (dating back the previous challenge). I can finally rest knowing
that I am not putting off any goal. I am done! It is day 289 (or day 2 of week 42), and there is still 20% of the time
remaining in the challenge. What do I do with the extra time?
</p>
<p class="answer">
I have also finished the goal of running 1000 kilometers last week. In fact, I finished today strongly with over 34,000 steps
and a 10K run. I have almost 650 miles of running complete! I had to run on a trail in the near darkness today, but I no longer
have to worry about that. I don't have to worry about darkness, cold weather, sport game conflicts or taking a vacation to get
extra steps. I now have the freedom to play things by ear. And more importantly, I can take time to accomplish some of the chores
I have been neglecting to finish the goals of this challenge. What a day!
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period eleven go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Obviously the big news of this period is that I finished my "Walk Across America." Wonderful. I think I am still trying to
understand the accomplishment. Meanwhile, I continue to walk and run.
</p>
<p class="answer">
Last period I asked myself what I should do with the extra time. My first thought was just to pick some easy new goal and
putter out. I figured that 7.5 million steps was too many; 7.0 million was too little and hardly a challenge. There wasn't
a number in between that stood out to me as being interesting. And so I decided that 7,171,717 was an interesting number.
And for a bit, I made that my goal. It also afforded me plenty of days to take off because my remaining average was so low. But
then it struck me. What was such little walking doing to my average? Oh my! I was on track to let my daily average to fall
below 20,000 steps per day. And so Eureka! It wasn't so much the number of steps in the year that interested me as much as
having an interesting daily average. So to maintain 20,000 for an entire year, I need to reach 7.3 million steps. So there
is an interesting number between 7.0 and 7.5 million steps (365 * 20,000 = 7,300,000). So despite having said I would stop
fiddling with the goal for the year, I have yet another new goal. Fortunately, my remaining average goal is still
less that 12,500 and I shouldn't have to struggle obtaining the new goal of 7.3 million steps.
</p>
<p class="answer">
The cold weather is coming. Autumn is here even though most of the trees around have yet to start letting their leaves fall
off. It is strange to see so many trees still with green leaves this late into the season. About I week ago I had a training
run and I had to run in the dark and cold weather. It was not very pleasant. I arrived home with hands so cold I struggled unlocking
my door with the key. I was certainly thinking to myself that this wasn't fun. But this past Sunday (the first Sunday of the 12th
period), I ran a half marathon. And I crushed this race too! And where as that training run made me feel down, the half marathon
put me back on top of the world! All the training I did paid off, and paid off big time. That race put me over the 700 mile mark
for the year. Truly amazing, as I started this challenge wondering if even 500 miles was possible. My remaining average for
running is below three miles per week to get 730 miles (a value corresponding to 7.3 million steps).
</p>
<p class="answer">
Now my focus returns back to walking. I have the cold weather gear back out, and it is time to acclimate myself to cold brisk walks.
I am not giving up on the running though. I am still planning on a 10K race in a few weeks, so I still have to keep up my
training.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period twelve go? Only four weeks to go...
</p>
<p class="answer">
Leaves have finally changed and one week later a wind and rain storm knocked most of them down. Colder weather is also here,
but there are also some really nice days. On a couple of those days I took time to rake up all those leaves. I got back to
walking a lot... particularly to get used to the colder weather. I got my average down to below 8,000 steps.... I must
say, I have been feeling the difference of walking more. My body is enjoying it. I can't say I was missing it, but it sure
feels nice walking more.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I also completed my last race for the year. Sadly, the weather did not cooperate. It rained the entire time, although never
a big down pour. But there were puddles everywhere and by the end of the race my shoes and clothes were soaked. While
running, I wasn't cold, but after the race when I cooled down, I become quite cold. On the bright side, I was quite pleased
with my time. I can't say I enjoyed the run. It was a little boring because the rain kept the people away from cheering runners.
I thought I would have a lousy time, but I ran 10K in less than 50 minutes. Not too bad for me in lousy weather and not
really feeling it.
</p>
<p class="answer">
For quite a while now I have been thinking about my plan after this challenge. I thought about many things I could do. 
I went from plans that included standard deviations and rolling averages to plans that had me not even tracking anything.
I clearly remember earlier this year feeling that I was too tied to the pedometer and convincing my myself to set it aside
once this challenge is over. But it is totally my fault that I started this year with a plan for 5 million steps, and now
I am looking at having exceeded that amount by almost 50%. But the situation is different. Last year I was eager to get
back into running and losing a last bit of weight. And I achieved that! So now there isn't anything I really want to do
other than maintain where I am at. And so I went full circle with many plans and finally arrived back to why I started these
challenges. I wanted 1) to be active and not sendentary 2) be in good shape which I define as being able to run a 10K race
and 3) have my weight under control. So my plan is essentially to ask myself periodically if I can positively answer to
myself those three questions. So next year is about finding the minimum amount that is needed to do that. I think it is
safe to say I am walking too much. So I will start off with roughly 7,000 steps per day on average.

I initially thought that I would begin this plan for the last period. But another idea took over. This last period is the
traditional holiday eating time of year. I knew I would be eating too much. And from last year's challenge I would gain weight.
So I am thinking that I should keep up the walking and running and watch what I eat more. I definitely need to apply self
control and not over eat. What I hope to say is that by the end of the year that I walked a lot, I ran a lot and my weight
is below (or at) where I wanted it to be for this challenge (even though that wasn't the challenge, mind you). So we shall see.

Only three weeks to go...

Ha! The 7.3 million step goal didn't take long to reach.  I had a few errands to do and strangely they were ones that allowed
me an opportunity to walk to. And so I did. And now it is seemingly a foregone conclusion that I will get to 7.5 million steps.
I will also likely get to the 800 mile running milestone. So far, so good.
