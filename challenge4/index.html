<h1>
Have Fun - Challenge #4
</h1>
<p>
This challenge is the "have fun" challenge.
</p>
<p>
I decided to not have a well defined challenge in terms of steps or running distance. But to have a graph to display, the walking
goal will begin at 200,000 steps walking and 50 miles of running per period. Have fun.

<h2>Team A</h2>

Team A is a team of one individual. This walker uses an Omron HJ-321 kept safely in a pocket to track steps.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p class="question">
How did period one go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
When one researches how many steps a day one should walk a day to stay healthy, a common number that
is seen is 7,000 steps. Coming off last year's challenge, I was curious how close to that number I get
just by doing my usual running and cutting back on the extra walks. It turns out that so far I am averaging
more than 10,000 steps. With this in mind, I will continue to focus on running, and only take walks when the
feeling strikes me, and I will stay with a goal of at least 200,000 steps per period.
</p>
<p>
Running wise, I am doing very well with an average of nearly 25 miles per week. It may not be your idea of
fun, but I'm back into half marathon training mode. So I am scheduling a long run per week and getting it
done despite the snow and cold weather. The last run of this period was an ad hoc run through the streets of
a big neighborhood just so I wouldn't slip on icy sidewalks. I ran for at least nine miles. But that is what
one does to get the miles done.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period two go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
The snow storms continued, and it still forced me into ad hoc courses because the sidewalks were covered with snow
and ice. The snow and ice hung around for two weeks before it melted enough for normal courses. It is amusing to
me that my running is enough to cover my walking requirement. I am not scheduling my day around blocks of time
where I need to go out to walk to get another ten thousand steps. Now I am spending my time on other things, but
you wouldn't know that. I completed the period with a 14 mile run in sunny but chilly weather, and that got me to the
200 mile mark for the year.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period three go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Well dang... as you can see in the running chart, things took a turn for the worse. I was out on a training run that
was planned to be approximately 15 or 16 miles. I made it about 13 miles when I felt that I couldn't go further and
had to make the long walk home. Unfortunately this was a week before a scheduled half marathon race. In order to not
make matters worse, I only ran a couple of short runs during the week to see if my body felt ok, and it did. On the
morning of the half marathon race, I did feel fine, and the race began very well. But out of nowhere, knee tendonitis
came on strong at mile five, and never got better. Furthermore, the weather was below freezing with a brisk wind. The wind
chill wasn't a problem until after the race when the walk back to the parking garage was awful with the feeling that I
was losing a few extremities. I had hopes of getting a time better than an hour and fifty minutes. But at mile nine, the
pacer had caught up to me, and I was hurting too much to keep up. But I had to leave it all on the course, and got a
time of 1:51. Oh well, better luck next time. It was not a fun time.

I needed a few days before my knee and ankle felt ok just walking around. I had to make the decision that my marathon
attempt for this year would not happen. I just don't have the ability to stave off injuries. As of the end of this period
I am still way down on mileage waiting for the tendonitis to go away.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period four go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Badly. The injuries continue, and I feel as though this past period was my laziest in a long time. I think I need to work
harder on not rushing back full strength, But that seems harder than it should be. I felt good doing the last 10K, but
my knee and ankle were really bad the next day, Sure it was fine after a few more days, but this process is not sustainable.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period five and six go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
I did not post anything for period five because I was still feeling a bit depressed. Sure I was getting better, but I was not
running much. At the end of this period, I can really tell that I have decreased abilities and I have quite a bit of work to
do to get back to a happy spot (say running a 10K in less than 50 minutes). As I was thinking about what to post for this period
I reminded myself how good I felt being in that happy spot and that should serve as incentive to work at getting there. Injuries
are terrible. I am about three months from the injury and it is only now that I think I can begin working back to the point
I want to get to.
</p>
<p class="answer">
I will add one interesting point. As I was taking rest from running, I thought I would try walking a bit more as a means of getting
more exercise. Out on a walk I was doing math in my head to figure how much walking I would need to get my daily average above 10,000
steps. But as days went on, I just forgot about that schedule and just went with the flow of the days. But strangely, the "flows"
of the day did get me above 10,000 steps per day. I did not make any effort to monitor the average. In fact, I went many days without
even logging the step count in this page even to see what my average was. But the little running I did, cutting grass here and there,
and walking errands instead of driving got me over 10,000. I find that interesting.
