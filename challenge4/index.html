<h1>
Have Fun - Challenge #4
</h1>
<p>
This challenge is the "have fun" challenge.
</p>
<p>
I decided to not have a well defined challenge in terms of steps or running distance. But to have a graph to display, the walking
goal will begin at 200,000 steps walking and 50 miles of running per period. Have fun.

<h2>Team A</h2>
<p>
Team A is a team of one individual. This walker uses an Omron HJ-321 kept safely in a pocket to track steps.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p class="question">
How did period one go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
When one researches how many steps a day one should walk a day to stay healthy, a common number that
is seen is 7,000 steps. Coming off last year's challenge, I was curious how close to that number I get
just by doing my usual running and cutting back on the extra walks. It turns out that so far I am averaging
more than 10,000 steps. With this in mind, I will continue to focus on running, and only take walks when the
feeling strikes me, and I will stay with a goal of at least 200,000 steps per period.
</p>
<p>
Running wise, I am doing very well with an average of nearly 25 miles per week. It may not be your idea of
fun, but I'm back into half marathon training mode. So I am scheduling a long run per week and getting it
done despite the snow and cold weather. The last run of this period was an ad hoc run through the streets of
a big neighborhood just so I wouldn't slip on icy sidewalks. I ran for at least nine miles. But that is what
one does to get the miles done.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did period two go?
</p>
<p class="answer">
The snow storms continued, and it still forced me into ad hoc courses because the sidewalks were covered with snow
and ice. The snow and ice hung around for two weeks before it melted enough for normal courses. It is amusing to
me that my running is enough to cover my walking requirement. I am not scheduling my day around blocks of time
where I need to go out to walk to get another ten thousand steps. Now I am spending my time on other things, but
you wouldn't know that. I completed the period with a 14 mile run in sunny but chilly weather, and that got me to the
200 mile mark for the year.
