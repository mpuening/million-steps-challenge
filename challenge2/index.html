<h1>
Million Steps Challenge #2
</h1>
<p>
This is the second one million step challenge.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Team A</h2>
<p>
Team A is a team of one individual. This walker initially used an Omron HJ-113 pedometer clipped to the
belt to track steps. However, that pedometer was lost in a leaf raking incident (hopefully to be found
in the future). A replacement Omron HJ-321 was ordered and kept more safely in a pocket. A few days of
steps were estimated based on time and recalled steps from previous walks. Then a few days were repeated
exactly and then measured with the new pedometer. Those are the 31,363 step days to make up for the 1,000
step day in which a snow storm blew through (that day was also estimated).

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p class="question">
How fast do you walk?
</p>
<p class="answer">
I walk on average one mile in 16:40. And with about
2,000 steps per mile, one hour of walking yields about 7,200 steps.
This means I averaged about 3 hours of walking everyday.
</p>
<p class="question">
You recently finished another million step challenge. Why do another so soon?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Earlier this year, I achieved my weight loss goal, and I switched over to running to
maintain my weight. I was doing great with my running pace when I injured a big toe.
I hoped my toe would heal, but it did not do so quickly. So while hobbling home one
day after a failed run, I decided I would do another million step challenge. But this
one is different. The goal is to not get one million steps as quickly as possible, but
only to average about 20,000 steps per day. The idea is to see if 20,000 steps is enough
to maintain my weight and fitness despite a holiday diet of leftover halloween candy,
ice cream, and other holiday goodies and meals.
</p>
<p class="question">
Did it work?
</p>
<p class="answer">
Ha! No! I permitted myself to indulge as much as possible. And as the big holidays
approached, the more goodies were right in front of me. And boy, did I eat too much. No
need to apologize, for I signed up for this. I gained about five pounds, and probably
worse, a couple of percentage points of body fat. So as this challenge comes to an end,
another one starts. Time to start running again.
